# Hey, I'm Gideon Shaked 👋

**I want to build things that make a difference.** When I program, I'm obsessed with generality, maintainability, and extendability. **I love making stuff that does useful things.** Currently I'm interested in data science/machine learning, bioinformatics, and software design. I'm a high schooler in Miami, FL. I love Linux and free and open-source software (FOSS).

Some of my projects include:

* 🚀 [Nextinspace](https://github.com/The-Kid-Gid/nextinspace): A CLI tool to track rocket launches and other space-related events; it can also be used as a Python library. [OSTechNix article](https://ostechnix.com/print-latest-space-events-with-nextinspace-in-terminal). [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/nextinspace?period=total&units=none&left_color=grey&right_color=blue&left_text=Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/nextinspace)

* 🔬 [LIBS Movement System](https://github.com/libs-movement-system): A 5-axis movement/positioning system for [laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy).

* 🧰 [Dotfiles](https://github.com/The-Kid-Gid/dotfiles): Not just your typical dotfiles project. This config incorporates modular, multi-machine design so that I (or you) can be up and running with just a quick `./install-profile <profile>`.
